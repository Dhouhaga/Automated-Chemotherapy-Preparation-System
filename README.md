# End of study project: <br> Automated-Chemotherapy-Preparation-System

> Created by [Dhouha GAOUD].
Proposed by ASQII and supervised by Prof. Chiheb Ameur ABID.


## Context

This project was developed as part of my end-of-study requirements in Computer Engineering, specializing in Embedded Systems and IoT, in collaboration with ASQII. The Automated Chemotherapy Preparation System aims to improve the accuracy and safety of chemotherapy drug preparation by automating key processes.

This repository contains a high-level overview, key features, and general information about the systemâ€™s design and implementation, without sharing proprietary source code or details.

## Key Features
Automated Dosage Preparation: Ensures precise dosage measurements through controlled mechanisms, minimizing human error.
Real-Time Monitoring: Provides continuous monitoring for accuracy and safety during preparation.
User Interaction Interface: Includes an intuitive interface designed for ease of use by healthcare professionals.

## Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, C++.
Frameworks and Tools: Flask (web interface), OCR (for data recognition).
Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4, stepper motors, servo motors, Pi Camera.
Project Type: Embedded System, IoT, Automation.

## System Architecture (General Overview)
The system is composed of a control unit based on Raspberry Pi 4, which interacts with motors and sensors to handle dosage preparation. A web-based dashboard, built using Flask, provides real-time monitoring and user controls. The setup uses OCR for verification and accuracy in drug identification.

> Specific architectural diagrams and source code are not included to maintain confidentiality.

## Disclaimer
Due to confidentiality agreements with ASQII, this repository provides an overview of the project without disclosing proprietary details or code.
